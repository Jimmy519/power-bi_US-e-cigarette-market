(the numbers are adjusted to prevent data leakage)

This is a project requested by the US sales team. They want to know clearly the market situation in the US and provide requirements for dashboard development.

Metrics included:
1. Coverage: the number of store that sell our product
2. MSRP: mean sales retail price
3. Daily Sales of Products: daily number of sales our product
4. Store Daily Sales of Products: daily number of sales of all products
5. In-house Coverage %: proportion of our sales compared with all products
6. Top 3 Favourtie: the most popular flavor

Visualizations included:
1. Locations of the stores that are researched
2. Price range of all products
3. Comparison between our product and competitors' products
4. The market of each researched state

Insights included:
1. Different States have different top 3 flavor, sales should adjust the selling of flavor accordingly
2. Some flavors are not welcome by the customers. Sales should avoid shipping anymore.
3. Some competitors only sell in certain states. Perhaps it is their strategy to focus on some states only.
4. Ways to increase market share:
   a) For some states, we are selling significantly higher price than competitors, we can lower the price if we want to increase market share
   b) For some states, we are selling lower, but our market share is still low. We can use other non-price means to increase market share. For example, we have found that if         we place a roller banner in the store, the sales will be increased by 10%.
